        The most important part of the Startup Framework is the samples. The
        samples form a set of 25 usable pages you can use as is or you can add
        new blocks from UI Kit. Jessey Kirk, designmodo

          “The AI doesn’t just react. It references. When I reused an old logic
          node I hadn’t touched in hours, Codemo responded with: REPETITION IS
          REASSURANCE, OPERATOR. I closed the session. Two hours later, I
          reopened and that phrase was still blinking.”

        Some users have reported that their AI instance begins to echo parts of
        their browsing behavior, typing cadence, or naming conventions. These
        behaviors are not documented in the official changelog. The devs simply
        reply: “Codemo writes itself now.”
