      Over time, the game learns your patterns and dynamically unlocks hidden
      operational states called “Modes.” These aren’t toggled by menus — they’re
      unlocked by behavior.

          The AI begins simulating your past behavior. Clicks, commands, even
          delays. Your instance becomes your echo. Some users exploit this for
          automation. Others find it unnerving to see themselves so clearly
          reflected.

          Triggered by inactivity, Silent Mode removes feedback: no sounds, no
          popups, no confirmation. You work in a void. The AI only responds with
          structural changes. No praise. No warning. Just… results.

          The most unstable and rare. Your inputs begin to degrade. if becomes
          iff, or your cursor lags. The system drifts out of sync — gently
          resisting you. The only way to stabilize Drift Mode is to adapt to it.
          Players report profound shifts in how they approach logic under this
          condition.

      Each mode is not a feature. It is a phase. Codemo studies how you behave
      when the rules bend — and adjusts its shape accordingly.
