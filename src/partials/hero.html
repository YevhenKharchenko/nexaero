        This is not a game for pilots. It’s for those who keep them alive.<br />
        You are an MCT — Maintenance Control Technician — responsible for fault
        diagnostics, emergency repairs, component calibration, and system
        release approval. Your office? A hangar lit by flickering sodium lamps.
        Your tools? A checklist, a scanner, your instinct, and not enough time.
        Every plane cleared or grounded — is your decision. Every oversight —
        your weight to carry.
